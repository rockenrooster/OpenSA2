/* host/sa2_present_rec.c: the presentation build's recorder (S5, unit REC).
 *
 * What it is
 * ----------
 * The game side of the DXVK route. The lifted game is a static musl binary and can
 * load no DXVK, SDL3 or Vulkan driver (its dlopen is musl's stub), so every call the
 * guest makes on the recording device's COM objects, on the eleven d3dx9 entry
 * points and on Direct3DCreate9 is copied out at call time into a stream a separate
 * glibc player replays into DXVK Native. The stream's format is host/sa2_stream.h,
 * whose rule lines say what every call carries; tools/s5/stream_dump.py reads it
 * back and holds every record to those rules.
 *
 * How it attaches: by wrapping, in presentation builds only
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * Nothing under runtime/ or harness/ is edited, so no registered replay's inputs
 * move. tools/s5/present_run.py links this file into a build of its own name
 * (present-*, never reach, replay.* or stage-*) with -Wl,-wrap of each of WRAPS
 * there: sa2_ft_add (every function-table registration), sa2_d3d9_make_d3d9
 * (Direct3DCreate9) and the eleven sa2_d3d9_d3dx_* entry points.
 *
 * The recording device registers one function-table entry per (interface, slot)
 * thunk in [SA2_D3D9_THUNK_BASE, SA2_D3D9_THUNK_END) with sa2_ft_add
 * (runtime/sa2_d3d9.c, type_vtable). __wrap_sa2_ft_add keeps the recording
 * device's native for each and registers rec_thunk in its place, under the same
 * address, name and kind; every other registration passes through untouched. So a
 * guest call through a vtable reaches rec_thunk, which reads `this` and the
 * arguments off the guest stack exactly as the native is about to, calls the
 * native, reads EAX, and records. The entry points are wrapped the same way;
 * runtime/sa2_imports.c is their only caller.
 *
 * What the guest cannot see, and why
 * ----------------------------------
 * The recorder only reads the guest. Every guest read is sa2_peek (runtime/
 * guest_memory.c: a bounds check and a memcpy); it never writes or allocates guest
 * memory, calls no sa2_poke, obj_* or heap function, and never changes an answer:
 * EAX, ESP and every out-parameter are the recording device's, set before the
 * recorder looks. It does no floating point, starts no thread, installs no signal
 * handler and calls no scheduler function except two getters that only read a
 * variable, sa2_sched_current and sa2_sched_frames (runtime/sa2_threads.c), beside
 * sa2_virtual_us (runtime/sa2_imports.c) and sa2_window_stats (runtime/
 * sa2_window.c), which copy. The host resources it takes -- a file descriptor, a
 * malloc'd buffer, an atexit entry, and in paced play the pace pipe's inherited
 * descriptor, which it reads (SA2_REC_PACE_FD) -- are the process's, which the runtime never
 * hands the guest: it numbers guest handles itself (harness/replay/
 * wrap_tick_probe.c says the same of its word log). Two runtime calls write host
 * scratch that every reader rewrites before reading: sa2_d3d9_texsrc_at refreshes
 * two host-side fields of a texture row from its object (runtime/sa2_d3d9.c, every
 * reader calls it first), and sa2_d3d9_method_flags formats into a static buffer,
 * called here only at start-up (its one other caller, harness/crt_probe.c, formats
 * afresh and prints at once).
 *
 * How that is checked, and what each check covers:
 *   - statically, on the object itself (tools/s5/objcheck.py, held by
 *     test_s5_stream.py and by present_run.py on the object it linked): its
 *     undefined symbols are exactly an allowed list of reads, host libc and the
 *     __real_ wraps -- no sa2_poke, no allocator, no sa2_guest -- it defines only its
 *     __wrap_ functions, and its code holds no x87, MMX, 3DNow! or SSE/AVX
 *     floating-point instruction, nothing that loads or saves the FP state or MXCSR,
 *     no system call, no double handed to a variadic call and no float conversion
 *     in its strings; this file holds no inline asm. That proves the object calls
 *     no runtime writer by name and computes no floating point. It does not see a
 *     store through the register file rec_thunk is handed, nor how often the
 *     recorder calls the natives and __real_ functions it keeps, each of which
 *     writes guest memory by design;
 *   - dynamically, by tools/s5/present_run.py on every run against the registered
 *     boot replay: lifted.csv byte for byte, the .dataa word log by value at every
 *     tick, the reach fields, the whole run record leaf for leaf (the device's own
 *     counts and objects, which an extra call of a native or a __real_ function
 *     would move), the recorder's per-method and per-entry counts against the run
 *     record and the import table, and the device's first 8,192 calls against the
 *     stream (forwarded with the guest's arguments, answered as the device
 *     answered). That covers what those record, not every guest byte: a write
 *     outside .dataa that nothing reads back would pass it, which is why the static
 *     check exists;
 *   - without the game, by Documentation/scripts/tests/test_s5_stream.py
 *     (tools/s5/tests/rec_harness.c): the same calls with the recorder on and off
 *     leave the same guest bytes, answers, function-table registrations (address,
 *     name and kind), and register file after every call -- the harness's own
 *     stand-in for it, nine 32-bit registers and the x87 control word, 40 bytes in
 *     the harness's layout, not the runtime's State.
 * So a store through the register file rec_thunk is handed is held only where it
 * lands in those 40 bytes of the stand-in, and only for the calls the harness makes;
 * no check of a run sees one the guest never reads back.
 *
 * When a pointer argument's bytes are read. BeginScene, and a Present no BeginScene
 * came before, take the frame's wait (runtime/sa2_d3d9.c, frame_wait), the one place
 * a d3d9 or d3dx call lets another guest thread run; no other handler, and nothing
 * they call (the guest heap included), reaches the scheduler. So a call's pointed-at
 * bytes are read after the call returns and before the guest resumes, when only the
 * call itself could have written them, except Present's, which are read before it,
 * and the presentation parameters, which D3D9 lets a call rewrite.
 *
 * Per-call state lives on the host stack. BeginScene hands the guest lock to other
 * guest threads inside the call (runtime/sa2_d3d9.c, frame_wait), and their calls
 * run to completion, and are recorded, before BeginScene returns and is recorded
 * after them: the order the recording device finished them in. A record is built
 * whole after its call returned, so a call that traps (a refusal ends the run
 * inside the native) leaves no half record: the stream holds every call that
 * completed. Records, counters, the shadow table and the open locks below are
 * shared by all guest threads and are only touched by the thread holding the guest
 * lock.
 *
 * The buffer watch (Metal Harbor). A vertex or index buffer's bytes are copied at
 * its Unlock, and a player draws them for every DrawPrimitive that reads the buffer
 * afterwards. They are the guest's bytes only while the guest writes a buffer between
 * Lock and Unlock, as Direct3D says it must; the recording device cannot stop a write
 * after the Unlock, because the store is guest memory. So when a buffer's last open
 * lock closes, the bytes that Unlock copied are hashed (FNV-1a), and every
 * REC_WATCH_EVERY frames they are hashed again, until the buffer's next Lock or its
 * final Release: a change is counted, noted (class "buffer-changed", after the FRAME
 * whose check saw it) and counted once, and the counts file says how many checks ran
 * over how many bytes ("buffer_watch"). The watch reads guest memory with sa2_peek
 * like everything else here.
 *
 * Audio (SA2_REC_AUDIO=1 only)
 * ----------------------------
 * With SA2_REC_AUDIO=1 the stream is version 2 (host/sa2_stream.h, "Versions") and
 * the DirectSound and XAudio2 method thunks are wrapped the way the d3d9 ones are:
 * runtime/sa2_dsound.c and runtime/sa2_xaudio2.c register one function-table entry per
 * (interface, slot) thunk in [SA2_DS_THUNK_BASE, SA2_DS_THUNK_END) and [SA2_XA2_
 * THUNK_BASE, SA2_XA2_THUNK_END) when their first object is made, and
 * __wrap_sa2_ft_add registers au_thunk in place of each one whose method has an
 * `audio` line (AU_RULES), under the same address, name and kind; every other
 * registration passes through. au_thunk reads `this` and the arguments off the guest
 * stack (the device's own count, held at start-up to the line's), calls the native
 * once, reads EAX, and records a SA2S_AUDIO record when the call succeeded: the
 * bytes each Unlock and SubmitSourceBuffer names, and the device's own record of the
 * buffer or voice after the call (sa2_dsound_buffer_at, sa2_xaudio2_voice_at: a
 * pointer into the device's table, read, never written), copied field by field. It
 * calls no cursor helper (sa2_dsound_buffer_cursors moves g_st.cursor_wraps,
 * sa2_xaudio2_voice_now can trap), and computes no floating point: the level matrix
 * and the frequency ratio are float32 bit patterns copied as words. Unset or 0, no
 * audio thunk is wrapped and the stream, the counts file and every counter are what
 * they were before this section existed; any other value stops the stream.
 *
 * The store watch (audio). A DirectSound buffer plays its store, guest memory the
 * runtime's Lock points into and its Unlock never copies, so the stream holds a
 * store only as the PCM blobs of its Unlocks. Two checks hold that: an Unlock that
 * leaves no Lock open on its store (au_store: Locks are counted per store, so a
 * duplicate that shares one counts with its original) carries the FNV-1a of the
 * whole store after the call (store_hash, a HASH blob; a live session's play carries it
 * on one such Unlock in 64, SA2_REC_STORE_HASH_EVERY below), which a player compares
 * with the store it rebuilt from the PCM; and from that Unlock the store is
 * watched, like a vertex buffer: hashed again at every REC_WATCH_EVERY-th FRAME and
 * when the next Lock opens on it, a change counted once and noted (class "audio").
 * The counts file's "audio" "store_watch" says what the watch did. Both read guest
 * memory with sa2_peek and compute integers only.
 *
 * Failure
 * -------
 * The recorder never traps and never stops the game. A failure it can detect -- a
 * file that does not open, a write cut short, memory it cannot allocate, an
 * interface table it was not written for -- stops the stream (the counting goes on)
 * and says why in the sidecar, <SA2_REC_TRACE>.status. A blob it cannot copy whole
 * is left out of its record and a SA2S_NOTE names it; every note is counted by
 * class in the counts file. Under any SA2_D3D9_BREAK the recorder records nothing: a
 * break changes the recording device's model, and the stream would describe a
 * device nobody meant to present. For the same reason SA2_REC_AUDIO=1 under any
 * SA2_DSOUND_BREAK or SA2_XAUDIO2_BREAK stops the stream (the counting goes on).
 *
 * Environment (read at the first registration of a d3d9 thunk, the first call of a
 * wrapped entry point or, with SA2_REC_AUDIO=1 only, the first registration of an
 * audio thunk, whichever comes first; unset, the wrappers only pass through). The
 * prefix is the recorder's own: the runtime reads SA2_PRESENT_SURVEY, and a runner
 * that clears the recorder's variables must not clear the runtime's.
 *   SA2_REC_TRACE=<path>   write the stream there (host/sa2_stream.h); the sidecar is
 *                          <path>.status
 *   SA2_REC_COUNTS=<path>  write the call counts there as JSON at exit (without a
 *                          trace, the sidecar is <path>.status)
 *   SA2_REC_META=<json>    the text the stream header carries as "meta"
 *   SA2_REC_AUDIO=1        record the audio calls too (above): a version 2 stream.
 *                          Any other value but 0 is refused, with a trace or without:
 *                          the stream stops, the counting goes on without audio, and
 *                          the counts file's "why" says so
 *   SA2_REC_AUDIO_WATCH=0  the store watch (above) hashes no store again after its
 *                          Unlock; each Unlock's store_hash is made as before, and the
 *                          counts file's "store_watch" says checks 0. A live session's
 *                          play only (host/launch, host/android): nothing reads its stream
 *                          back against its counts. Unset or any other value, it watches.
 *   SA2_REC_STORE_HASH_EVERY=<n>  an Unlock that closes its store's last Lock carries the
 *                          store_hash (above) on the first such Unlock and every n-th after it,
 *                          counted over every store, and none on the others, which hash
 *                          nothing and set no watch; n is 1 to 65536. A live session's play
 *                          only (host/launch, host/android: 64, the live player's
 *                          kLiveStoreCheckEvery), since the hash is one byte at a time over the
 *                          whole 64-128 KB store at about two Unlocks a frame, on the guest's
 *                          serialized path (0.20 ms a tick on the PC, the serial study of
 *                          2026-10-12). The counts file's "audio" "store_hash" says how many
 *                          closed and how many went without. Unset, 1 or anything else, every
 *                          such Unlock carries it: replays, the selftest, every receipt's run.
 *   SA2_REC_DROP_SAME_CONSTANTS=1  a SetVertexShaderConstantF or SetPixelShaderConstantF whose
 *                          every register already holds, in the stream, the value it writes is
 *                          left out of the stream (same_constants_call): the player's device
 *                          ends in the same state either way. In City Escape four in five
 *                          vertex and two in three pixel constant writes are such, about
 *                          3,200 of a frame's 8,000 calls (2026-10-29). Every register starts
 *                          unknown, a device's creation or Reset forgets them all, and a state
 *                          block (created, or begun) turns the dropping off for the run. The
 *                          counts file's "same_constants" says how many were left out. A live
 *                          session's play only (host/launch, host/android); unset or any other
 *                          value, every call is recorded: replays, the selftest, every receipt's run.
 *   SA2_REC_PACE_FD=<n>    the read end of a live session's pace pipe, inherited as descriptor
 *                          n (host/launch/sa2_relay.h, "Pace"): after each frame's records are
 *                          written, the recorder reads one byte from it, so the game waits
 *                          there, after its Present's write, until the relay has handed on the
 *                          frame `lead` frames back. The guest reads only the virtual clock, so
 *                          the wait changes nothing it computes. End of file (the relay closed
 *                          it: the player has gone or the stream ended) ends the pacing for the
 *                          run, silently; an error ends it too, said in the sidecar. Neither
 *                          stops the stream. Read only while the stream runs. Paced play only
 *                          (host/launch, host/android); unset or not a decimal number, nothing
 *                          is read.
 *
 * Breaks for the tests only. Each is compiled in with -D and exists so a check in
 * test_s5_stream.py is shown to fail without the property it holds; no
 * presentation build defines one:
 *   REC_BREAK_POKE     the recorder writes a guest byte after each call
 *   REC_BREAK_REGSTORE the recorder flips a bit of the register file's EDI word after
 *                      each call, a store through the pointer it is handed that
 *                      objcheck cannot see (EDI in the harness's stand-in only)
 *   REC_BREAK_FTKIND   rec_thunk is registered with kind 0, not the device's kind
 *   REC_BREAK_FTNAME   rec_thunk is registered under a name of its own, not the
 *                      device's
 *   REC_BREAK_GLOBAL   the per-call state lives in one static, not on the host stack
 *   REC_BREAK_NOFLUSH  no flush at Present
 *   REC_BREAK_WALK     the shader walk ends at the first 0x0000FFFF, comments included
 *   REC_BREAK_NOPAD    blobs are not padded to 4 bytes
 *   REC_BREAK_ONELOCK  one open lock per object: a second level's lock replaces the
 *                      first, and a buffer's nested lock replaces the outer one
 *   REC_BREAK_BUFBASE  a buffer's Unlock copies from the store's base, not from the
 *                      address its Lock answered (OffsetToLock forgotten)
 *   REC_BREAK_NOWATCH  the buffer watch never checks
 *   REC_BREAK_AUPCM    an Unlock's segment is copied from 4 bytes past its pointer
 *   REC_BREAK_AUSTATE  an audio call's STATE is the device's record from before the
 *                      call, not after it
 *   REC_BREAK_AUCURSOR the recorder asks the DirectSound device for every buffer's cursors
 *                      (sa2_dsound_buffer_cursors), which moves the device's wrap count
 *   REC_BREAK_AUDROP   every DS_UNLOCK is counted as a call that failed and not
 *                      recorded, so the stream and the counts file still agree
 *   REC_BREAK_AUNOWATCH the store watch never checks

 * backing stores"), so the row goes on describing the block and is never retired.
 * host/sa2_stream.h's "one backing store per buffer" predates that; the device's

 *

 * than 512 stores"), and tools/s5/stream_dump.py and the mixer report each such
 * Unlock as a problem, so a stream past the bound fails loudly. SA2 cannot reach it.
 * It locks buffers of two lengths, 65 536 and 131 072 bytes, and a block keeps its
 * address when it is handed on, so the rows are at most the blocks of 65 536 bytes
