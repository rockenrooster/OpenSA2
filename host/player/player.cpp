// Two binaries are built from this file. sa2_player (host/player/build.sh) is the
// DXVK host, as everywhere above. sa2_player_gpu (host/d3d9gpu/build.sh, with
// SA2_PLAYER_GPU=1) is the second host: host/d3d9gpu's Direct3D 9 on SDL_gpu (no
// shader route yet, so it counts every draw and draws none) linked in statically, so
// its renderer is its own file, pinned as files.player like every player's. It loads
// no DXVK library and reads no dxvk.conf: it pins neither, verifies neither, expects
// neither (both null in its report), refuses --dxvk, and leaves DXVK's preconditions
// (DXVK_WSI_DRIVER, DXVK_CONFIG_FILE, DXVK_CONFIG) out. Its report has the DXVK
// player's fields, host_identity.d3d9_host naming which binary wrote it. Its first
// argument may be --clear-matrix [--hidden]: host/d3d9gpu/test/clear_matrix.h through
// its own Direct3DCreate9, one line per case (the SDL_gpu leg of
// host/d3d9gpu/test_d3d9gpu.sh step 2 and compare_hosts.py's check i).
//
// Output paths (--report, --frames-out and its times file, --snap-dir, --audio-wav
// and its .json, --pace-log, and DXVK's log directory, DXVK_LOG_PATH or else the current directory) must lie
// outside every git working tree, or inside its private/ directory (AGENTS.md
// rule 9: game frames are captures). Anything else is refused before a byte is
// written: the report's own path first, and then the rest, whose refusal the
// report records.
//
// Exit status (the report's "exit_status"; "failures" names every reason):
//   0  pass
//   1  an --expect pixel missed, or --expect selected nothing for the stage
//   2  usage, a refused output path, or a file that could not be read or written
//   3  the stream: open refused (magic, version, schema, header tables), a
//      malformed record, a seq gap, a record after END, no END (unless
//      --allow-truncated or the run stopped early by choice), an argc that
//      disagrees with the header's tables (for a D3DX record in a stream whose
//      header has no "entries" table, with host/sa2_stream.h), a call or entry
//      the tables do not name, an entries row that names another function than
//      the one this player replays under its number, an IDirect3D9 call on an
//      object no Direct3DCreate9 record answered (when the header says the
//      writer records it), a record kind version 1 does not have (the header
//      lets a reader skip one; this player cannot vouch for what it skipped),
//      a FRAME with no Present or a Present with no FRAME, virtual time running
//      backwards (in a version 2 stream, across FRAME and AUDIO records), an
//      AUDIO record whose op or argc the header's audio table does not give, any
//      NOTE record (the writer left something out; unless --allow-notes)
//   4  the replay: device creation failed, no Present replayed, an error the
//      player counted (among them a GetRenderTarget, GetDepthStencilSurface or
//      GetBackBuffer answer the bindings the player followed do not give), a
//      call, d3dx entry or argument value not handled (among them a
//      GetBackBuffer answer other than the implicit back buffer), a host call that
//      failed where the guest was answered success (except the named scene-order
//      rules below), a readback or Present that failed, the window closed; with
//      --audio or --audio-wav, an audio problem (mixer.h: a version 1 stream,
//      which holds no sound, among them), or no playback device for --audio
// The most basic class present decides the status: 2, then 3, then 4, then 1.
//
// The report is written on every exit after the arguments parse, unless its
// own path is refused. It is also written before it is final ("complete":
// false, "phase" says where): first of all (phase "start"), so a player that
// dies at any point leaves this run's report and never an earlier run's; just
// before Direct3DCreate9, because DXVK can abort the process there (see
// create_device); before CreateDevice; when the device is made (phase
// "replay", 0 Presents); and after every --report-every'th Present, with the
// counts so far. A report that is not final therefore counts K Presents where
// the run had made at least K and at most K + N (N = --report-every; with 0,
// no bound): tools/s5/play_report.py turns a signal exit into a verdict that
// names the phase and says so.
//
// --stats-only is a replay with no device. It runs the replay's own code at
// stage 3 with every host call left out: every stream check above, each
// call's and entry's plan (call_plan, kEntries), and every check a replay
// makes of a call's arguments, blobs and objects that needs no device (a blob
// missing or short, a shader or declaration without its terminator, an object
// no earlier call made, an Unlock with no Lock, a level outside its texture, a
// lock rectangle, a DESC or LOCK blob that disagrees with the call, a file
// that does not parse, an argument value the player does not implement). Each
// object a replay would make stands as made (Tex::made, CubeVol::made, Surf::made,
// Buf::made); texture levels are decoded, converted and filtered on the CPU as
// in a replay, and nothing is uploaded. It cannot see what only a device
// shows: device creation (the window, DXVK, CreateDevice), host answers (a
// host call that fails, and the objects a failed one would leave unmade),
// readbacks and pixels. So its counts and errors equal a stage 3 replay's
// wherever no host call fails.
//
// Cube and volume textures (IDirect3DDevice9::CreateCubeTexture and the four D3DX
// cube and volume creators) are made as 2D ones are, at the same stages: a DDS cube
// map's six faces or a DDS volume's slices at stage 2, their box-filtered mips, the
// plain creators and a cube face's lock upload (the surface GetCubeMapSurface
// answers) at stage 3. Each GetLevelCount, GetLevelDesc and GetCubeMapSurface
// answer is held to the creation the player followed and, where the host object has
// the level, to the host's answer. No game shader samples a cube or a volume, so a
// draw while one is bound is not handled, by name, and draws nothing.
//
// Input: every SDL input event is discarded (the guest's input is the
// recording's) and counted by kind; events are pumped every frame, while
// --pace sleeps, and while a live stream (STREAM "-" or a path that is a pipe
// or a socket) waits for its next bytes (stream.h, set_idle). A close request
// stops the run, which then fails ("the window was closed"). With --interactive
// --end-fd N, the first close request is instead an end request: every key is let up
// and the key sender closed (no key after it reaches the game), one byte is written to
// N for the caller (tools/s5/play_live.py) to end the game, and the run reads on to the
// stream's END, so a session closed by hand can still be final ("complete"). The window
// stays until then; a close request kForceCloseAfterS or more after the end request
// stops the run as before. SDL's quit on the last window's close is turned off in this
// mode, so one click is one request. SIGUSR1 is the caller's own end request, taken the
// same way (play_live sends it at the goal and at a Ctrl-C, so that the keys are let up
// before it stops the game). The report's "end_request" says what happened.
// The frames do not depend on window focus or occlusion: each is read back before its
// Present.
// With --interactive --input-path FIFO, and only then, the window's own key
// events also go to the game, as the DirectInput keyboard state the runtime
// reads from SA2_INPUT_DI_SOURCE (input.h, runtime/sa2_dinput.h); losing focus
// or closing lets every key up. The report gains "host_input" from the run's
// first report on, and its "started" turns true once the window is up and the
// FIFO checked.
//
// Gamepads: with --interactive --input-path, and only then, SDL's gamepads and the touch
// overlay (touch_overlay.h) go to the game too, as the four XInput slots of the FIFO's gamepad
// records (input.h send_pads, runtime/sa2_dinput.h "The host gamepads"). The game makes its pad
// objects once, at boot, for the slots then connected, so the pads are sent as soon as the FIFO
// is up, before the stream is read: every pad SDL knows then, in slots 0 to 3 in the order SDL
// lists them, and later ones in the order they arrive, each keeping its slot until it goes. The
// touch overlay is slot 0, connected from the start where touch is the platform's input
// (Android; SA2_TOUCH_CONTROLS=1 anywhere, 0 nowhere) and otherwise from its first touch; a
// physical pad given slot 0 then shares it with the overlay (buttons and triggers combined, each
// stick the one pushed further), so a phone's Bluetooth pad is player one with or without
// touches. A physical pad's button hides the overlay until the next touch. A press and its
// release are a record each; stick and finger motion is sent once per event pump. SDL raises
// the events on whichever thread it reads them on (Android's touches come from its UI thread):
// an event watch copies them, and the reader's idle service handles them here (service_pads),
// so the pads are set up at the first service of the live open, before the stream's first
// byte. Pads are SDL's default: no presses while the window is not focused. The overlay is
// drawn over each frame on the swapchain texture, after the frame is read back (so no frames
// file holds it), when the second host's device calls the function the window's property
// "sa2.present_overlay" holds at Present (host/d3d9gpu/d9g_gpu_sdl.cpp), with the frame and the
// swapchain texture; nothing is drawn before the first touch. The frame's size goes to the
// overlay at each Present, which then knows where the picture is (its controls go below a
// portrait window's picture). The overlay's settings (SA2_TOUCH_SCALE, SA2_TOUCH_OPACITY,
// SA2_TOUCH_LAYOUT, SA2_TOUCH_LAYOUT_PORTRAIT, SA2_TOUCH_MAP: touch_overlay.h) and SA2_PAD_MAP are
// read from the environment when the pads are set up, each said in the log ("pads: ..."), a
// malformed one with why it is not used. SA2_PAD_MAP=BUTTON=OUTPUT,... changes what a physical
// pad's button sends: BUTTON an SDL button by position (SOUTH EAST WEST NORTH BACK GUIDE START LS
// RS LB RB UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT MISC1 PADDLE1-4 TOUCHPAD), OUTPUT a game button (input.h
// pad_output_named; LT and RT hold that trigger all the way). The report's "host_pads" counts
// the pads, the records asked for and the overlay's draws.
//
// The picture's place (portrait play): SA2_PLAYER_PICTURE_Y=F, F 0 to 1, puts a letterboxed
// picture's centre at F of an upright window's height (0.25: the middle of its upper half), its
// top no higher than the window's safe area and no lower than centred; unset, or a window no taller
// than wide, the picture is centred as before. Before each Present the player gives the device that place and the safe area's top in
// pixels as the window's properties "sa2.picture_y" and "sa2.picture_min_top" (read beside
// host/d3d9gpu/d9g_gpu.h fit_rect), and the touch overlay the same (set_picture), so its band
// under the picture starts where the picture ends. Each new place is said in the log ("picture:
// WxH at rows T-B of the window ...").
// --synthetic-input F.tsv is the test of all this (Documentation/scripts/tests/
// test_player_pads_touch.py): lines "MS VERB ARGS", MS after the first Present: "pad-attach K",
// "pad-button K BUTTON 0|1", "pad-axis K AXIS VALUE", "pad-detach K" drive SDL virtual gamepad
// K (SDL_GamepadButton and SDL_GamepadAxis numbers), and "touch-down|touch-move|touch-up FINGER
// X Y" push finger events, X and Y normalised to the window, or "... FINGER @CONTROL [DX DY]" at
// an overlay control's centre (STICK, A, B, X, Y, START, LT, RT) moved by DX, DY stick radii;
// only virtual gamepads are then taken, and SDL's gamepad events are taken without window
// focus. --overlay-out DIR writes, for the first Presents, the frame as the device blits it to
// the swapchain and the same with the overlay over it (DIR/frame-N-game.png and
// DIR/frame-N-swapchain.png), rebuilt beside the swapchain, which cannot be read.
//
// Sound: with --audio or --audio-wav, every AUDIO record goes to the mixer
// (mixer.h) in stream order, and every Present closes the block of sound up to its
// FRAME's virtual time; what the records after the last FRAME render is the last
// block, closed at the end. Every block is written to --audio-wav at once, so the WAV
// holds the whole of the sound from the mixer's origin, the first timed record. With
// --audio the blocks also go to SDL's playback stream (float32 stereo 48 kHz), each
// queued as soon as its FRAME is read, before --pace waits for the frame's time --
// all but the first: the sound before the first Present is the WAV's alone, and the
// device gets kAudioLeadMs of silence in its place. So, while the replay keeps pace,
// the queue holds about that lead whenever a block is queued and the device never
// waits on the replay, and the sound plays kAudioLeadMs (and the device's own
// latency) after the frame it belongs to, whatever the stream. A block that finds the
// queue past kAudioQueueBound is dropped and counted, which is what an unpaced
// replay, faster than real time, does with its sound; --speed other than 1 is refused
// with --audio, since the sound plays at its own rate. The report's "audio" holds the
// mixer's counters, the device's (blocks queued and dropped, the lead, the queue's
// depth each time a block was queued, and its shortfalls: requests of the device the
// queue fell more than a frame short of while the replay was feeding it, counted in
// SDL's get callback, each a gap the listener heard) and the WAV's, and is there
// only when sound is asked for; without either option a version 1 stream plays
// exactly as it did before sound existed, and a version 2 stream's AUDIO records are
// counted and held to the header's table and nothing more. The WAV's .json names its
// first sample's virtual time and the first FRAME's, which
// tools/s5/frames_to_video.py aligns the sound to the video by.
//
// Pace: with --pace each Present waits for its frame's time (pace.h). A live stream
// (--interactive's) may pace too: a game ahead of real time is then held to it by the
// stream itself, since the player reads no further while it waits and the writer's pipe
// fills (tools/s5/play_live.py bounds what its relay holds in between). Its schedule
// moves when a frame is later than kAudioLeadMs, so a game that falls behind is never
// shown fast afterwards to make up more than that. The report's "pace" counts the
// waits, the lateness and the moves, and the virtual time over the wall time between
// the first paced Present and the last; --pace-log writes the same per frame, on
// CLOCK_MONOTONIC (the clock of "t_start_monotonic_s"), for another process's clock to
// be set beside.
//
// Host tweaks (tweaks.h; runtime/sa2_tweaks.h lists every tweak, the game's and the host's):
// SA2_TWEAKS, read once, in a play session alone (--interactive with --input-path, no synthetic
// input, no SA2_REPLAY_TICKS or SA2_REPLAY_WORDS: the game's, which the launcher and the Android
// session give the player beside SA2_TWEAKS), and one stderr line, "sa2 host tweaks (player):
// ...", whenever it is set. Each tweak whose home is the player is its own file,
// host/player/tweaks/<name>.cpp, and tests sa2tw::on first: with none named, and in every replay,
// the player is the build it was.
//
// The window, measured: at every Present the window's SDL flags are sampled
// just before the Present, and the report's "window" keeps them by frame
// ("flags_at_present": runs of [first frame, last frame, SDL_WindowFlags], with
// "flag_bits" naming the bits), with counts, the window and input events with
// their time and frame, and how long the window went unpumped.
// "t_start_monotonic_s" is the CLOCK_MONOTONIC time the times file's wall_us
// counts from, so another process's clock can be set beside each frame's
// read-back. On Wayland only two of the flags come from the compositor:
// keyboard focus (wl_keyboard.enter) and OCCLUDED, which SDL sets only from
// xdg_toplevel's suspended state; SDL sets HIDDEN and MINIMIZED only when the
// application asks, and this player never does.
